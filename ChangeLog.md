- Order: add dependencySortRpmOpts
- add a newline between cycles

# 0.4.1 (2020-08-03)
- no longer assume pkg dir = pkg name (though still optimize for it)
- output any subcycles for cyclic graph (suggested by QuLogic)

# 0.4.0 (2020-07-29)
- performance: rework just to use String and only parse spec files once
  and also use faster PatriciaTree.Gr
  On about 500 packages roughly twice as fast as 0.3.1

- new 'layers' command outputs packages in ordered dependency independent layers
- new 'chain' command outputs Fedora chain-build format
- new 'leaves' commands to list outer leaf packages
- new 'roots' commands lists lowest dependencies
- new library exposed with 2 modules: low-level Graph and high-level Order:
  - Distribution.RPM.Build.Order provides: dependencySort, dependencySortParallel,
    dependencyLayers, sortGraph output
  - Distribution.RPM.Build.Graph provides: createGraph, dependencyNodes,
    subgraph', packageLayers, etc
- graph Nodes are now only labelled by package/spec filepath
  and no longer carry redundant dependency lists
